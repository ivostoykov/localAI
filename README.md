## What is LocalAI?

LocalAI is designed to bridge the gap where traditional tools fall short—offering access to web content, local files, and on-the-go resource fetching.

## Why use it?

If you value privacy but still want the power of LLMs, LocalAI is for you. There’s no need to install applications, deal with configurations, or handle version compatibility issues. It works seamlessly with Chrome, Firefox, and their derivatives.

### Key Benefits:

* **Local Control:** Your data stays on your device—no sharing or storing of your actions. You control what to keep or delete.
* **Task Assistance:** Need summaries or quick insights? LocalAI helps with tasks using the information in your active tab.
* **Custom Prompts:** Create, store, and execute your own prompts locally for a personalised experience.
* **External Hooks:** Enhance functionality by integrating your own solutions and resources.

## What do you need to use it?

You’ll need enough hardware power, preferably with a GPU.

A local AI tool—these are easy to set up, usually just download and run:

* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
* [Mozilla LlamaFile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)

And the browser extension.

It’s easy—give it a try and let us know your thoughts!
